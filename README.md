# Air Manager Panels for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024

We are a **fork** of [Simstrumentation](https://github.com/Simstrumentation/Air-Manager) as we update and add new instruments for both Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 as well as 2024.

We are active on their [Discord](https://discord.gg/6xkCXe5pMn) if you have any questions!

## Submit your own instruments

[Click on our Google Form](https://forms.gle/6TeXh5Q3rHtmLRB87) to submit your own instruments.

We would be VERY happy to see your creations! Our script will automatically create a pull request and update the source code so any changes are seen publically.

## Important Notes

* Due to numerous issues with MSFS2024, we have all files in a separate folder. We will NOT provide panels which are compatible with both versions from one siff file. You must use the separate siff.
* If you experience any issues with an instrument, first check the `source` folder for the instrument. In the source code, find `logic.lua` and you'll see (usually at the top) comments with regards to the code.
## Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024

UNDER CONSTRUCTION! Please submit your panels!

## Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020
